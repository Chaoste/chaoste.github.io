          The Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS challenge) encourages
          researchers to develop algorithms to support doctors in segmenting
          brain tumors. BraTS provides a large dataset of brain scans from
          patients who suï¬€ered of gliomas. Within this seminar we worked with
          several Deep Learning techniques adressing this problem.

          Besides for simple tasks like classifying the presence and the type of
          a glioma we also worked on segmenting the tumor area. To solve this
          problem we used a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN).
          Our last challenge was to predict a patient's survival rate. For this
          brain scans, the segmented tumor area and the patient's age were taken
          into account.
